== What and Why

"Amber" is a name for the project which I did for my thesis. The project helps
you manage a bike rental business in Vietnam, and is based on a real shop that I
have worked on in the past, so a lot of things are tailored for the place.

At first, I did not think that I would let this project comes to daylight, but
then I somehow got over the fear of it. I made a lot of bad decisions and the
code was a horrible mess, but at last, I put a lot of effort into my work and
it would be a waste to let it rot in the dark.
